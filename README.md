# 🧰 DevOps Templates & Configs

This repository is my personal collection of **YAML**, **CFG**, **templates**, and **scripts** for DevOps learning and experimentation.  
It’s mainly used for **self-practice**, **testing**, and **personal study** — not for production use.

Inspired by and referenced from several great open-source repositories:
- [devopshobbies/charts](https://github.com/devopshobbies/charts)
- [devopshobbies/ansible-templates](https://github.com/devopshobbies/ansible-templates)
- [devopshobbies/docker-templates](https://github.com/devopshobbies/docker-templates)
- [dennyzhang/kubernetes-yaml-templates](https://github.com/dennyzhang/kubernetes-yaml-templates)

## 🎯 Purpose

- A personal DevOps lab to store and reuse configuration files.  
- To practice automation tools like **Ansible**, **Docker**, **Helm**, and **Kubernetes**.  
- To serve as simple, easy-to-understand examples for **DevOps beginners**.  
- Used for **learning and testing only** — not production environments.
